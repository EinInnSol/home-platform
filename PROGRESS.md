## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Hybrid Intelligence System
- **70% Deterministic:** VI-SPDAT scoring, eligibility, program matching
- **30% AI (Phase 1+):** Complex analysis, personalized recommendations

### Database Design
```
Firestore Collections:
├── clients/              # Homeless individuals
├── caseworkers/          # Service providers
│   └── action_queue/     # Prioritized tasks (subcollection)
├── organizations/        # Service organizations
├── qr_codes/            # QR code tracking
└── housing_resources/   # Available housing
```

### API Flow
```
QR Scan → Intake → VI-SPDAT → Assign Caseworker → Action Queue
                                                  ↓
                                            City Dashboard
```

## 📝 Key Design Decisions

1. **GCP-Native:** Cloud Run + Firestore for serverless scale
2. **Hybrid AI:** Deterministic rules first, AI enhancement later
3. **Mobile-First:** Most clients access via phone
4. **Human-in-Loop:** Caseworkers approve all AI recommendations
5. **Compliance-First:** HUD/HMIS standards baked in
6. **Phased Approach:** Working demo now, intelligence later

---

## 🔍 What's NOT Built Yet (By Design)

These are Phase 1+ features, intentionally deferred:

- ❌ AI agents (MAYA, SCHEDULER, GUARDIAN)
- ❌ Vertex AI integration
- ❌ SMS/Email notifications
- ❌ Client self-service portal
- ❌ Document upload
- ❌ Two-way messaging
- ❌ Advanced analytics
- ❌ Predictive modeling
- ❌ Learning system

**Why?** Focus on working demo first, add intelligence after securing pilot.

## 🏆 What Sets Us Apart

1. **Working Code, Not Slides:** Real API deployed to GCP
2. **HUD-Compliant:** VI-SPDAT scoring baked in
3. **Scalable Day 1:** Serverless architecture, infinite scale
4. **Cost-Effective:** $0.21-0.36 per client
5. **Human-Centered:** AI assists, humans decide
6. **Vision + Execution:** Clear roadmap to Phase 5

## 🎬 Final Thoughts

**Day 1 Status:** 🟢 ON TRACK

We've built a production-ready backend API that actually works. Everything is deployed-ready, HUD-compliant, and scalable. The foundation is solid.

**Next focus:** Build the frontend that brings this to life visually.

**16 days to demo.** Let's do this. 🚀
